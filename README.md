**"Connect4 game"**

Connect 4 game that plays with a human player against the computer.

I started creating this game as an assignment in one of my Computer Science courses.

How to run the code:

1) Open command line and go to the directory where you saved the java program.
2) Type 'javac Connect4.java" and press enter to compile the code.
3) Type 'java Connect4.java' to run the program.
3) Now start playing.
